# Minor-Project-2-MR

## Overview
Environmental degradation and climate change have led to a weakened connection between biodiversity and human well-being. Many environmental monitoring systems present data in formats that are difficult for non-experts to interpret. Additionally, urbanization has contributed to a growing disconnect between people and their natural surroundings. To bridge this gap, we propose a Mixed Reality (MR) application that provides an interactive and immersive experience for users, making environmental data more accessible, engaging, and educational. This MR system will enhance environmental awareness while promoting adaptive wellness through interaction with real-time ecological information.

## Problem Statement 
Environmental monitoring systems often present data in complex formats, making it challenging for the general public to understand and engage with. Urbanization has further distanced people from nature, reducing their awareness of biodiversity and climate change issues. Our Mixed Reality Application addresses these challenges by offering an engaging, interactive MR interface that intuitively presents real-time environmental data, fostering awareness and promoting adaptive wellness.

## Objectives
- Develop a real-time collaborative whiteboard platform for multiple users.
- Enable different drawing pens and shape creation.
- Include real-time drawing with custom color and stroke adjustments.
- Support action history, version control, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- Provide session and state management with export options for saving whiteboard content.

## Technologies Used
- **Tools**: Unity Engine, Figma, Blender
- **SDKs**: Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), Meta All-in-One SDK, XR Interaction Toolkit
- **Programming Language**: C# (C-Sharp)
- **Hardware**: Meta Quest 3 / Meta Quest Pro

## Scope of the project
Through an interactive interface, our MR application integrates real-time environmental data, such as wildlife tracking, biodiversity metrics, and weather conditions. This platform aims to:

1. **Enhance Awareness**
- Provide real-time data on biodiversity, wildlife, and air quality.
- Allow users to explore and interact with environmental data dynamically.

2. **Support Education & Conservation**
- Serve as an engaging tool for teaching environmental topics.
- Raise awareness and support sustainability efforts.

## Future Work
- **Integration with Citizen Science**: Enable users to contribute by collecting and reporting environmental data through the MR system.
- **Predictive Environmental Modeling**: Use machine learning to forecast environmental changes and provide early warnings for biodiversity loss or climate change impacts.
- **Social Features**: Implement community engagement features, such as shared environmental challenges and collaborative conservation projects.
- **Extended Reality (XR) Support**: Expand to include Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) for wider accessibility.
- **Expanded Sensor Network**: Incorporate additional environmental sensors to enhance geographical coverage and data precision.
