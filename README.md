# 🌍 Minor-Project-2-MR: **LiveSphere - Mixed Reality Environmental Explorer**

## 🚀 Overview
**LiveSphere** is an immersive Mixed Reality (MR) application designed to bridge the gap between people and nature by transforming complex environmental data into an intuitive, engaging, and interactive experience. Using gesture-based interactions, real-time data integration, and region-specific simulations, this application enhances environmental awareness, promotes adaptive wellness, and supports sustainability education.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Environmental monitoring systems often present data in highly technical or fragmented formats, limiting public understanding and engagement. Rapid urbanization has also reduced people’s interaction with natural ecosystems. Our MR solution simplifies and gamifies this data through a hands-free, gesture-controlled platform, allowing users to explore biodiversity, climate patterns, and monuments in an immersive and accessible way.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Visualize real-time environmental data (biodiversity, weather, monuments) through an interactive MR interface.
- Enable continent and country selection via gestures, with GDP-based ranking for insights.
- Provide region-specific experiences including:
  - Simulated snowfall, sandstorms, and climate effects.
  - Visual exploration of endangered species and biodiversity hotspots.
  - 3D interactive monuments with scale control.
- Allow deep-dive into **India’s map**, with state-wise interaction and simulations.
- Implement custom gestures for UI split, object manipulation, and navigation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Design & Modeling:** Figma, Blender
- **SDKs:** Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK), Meta XR All-in-One SDK, XR Interaction Toolkit
- **Language:** C#
- **Hardware:** Meta Quest 3 / Meta Quest Pro

## 🧠 Features & Capabilities
- 🌐 **Multi-Continent Interaction**: Tap on any continent to load its map on your palm.
- 📈 **Country Ranking by GDP**: Select top 3 countries in a continent for focused insight.
- ✋ **Gesture-Controlled Palm UI**: Tap on palm buttons for:
  - Biodiversity 🌿
  - Weather ☁️
  - Monuments 🏛️
- 🌦️ **Environmental Simulation**:
  - Snowfall, rain, or sandstorm depending on selected geography.
- 🦜 **Biodiversity**: View endangered species and fauna of the region.
- 🏯 **Monuments**: Explore and scale monuments interactively.
- 🧤 **Custom Gestures**: UI split, object rotation, scaling, selection, and more.

## 🌍 Scope of the Project
This MR platform aims to:

### 1. Enhance Awareness
- Deliver real-time environmental data and visualizations.
- Strengthen public connection to nature through immersive exploration.

### 2. Support Education & Conservation
- Engage students, researchers, and citizens in climate and biodiversity topics.
- Promote sustainable behavior through experiential learning.
